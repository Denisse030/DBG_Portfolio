      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a passionate developer based in New York City who loves creating
        visually engaging and user-friendly websites. I enjoy blending
        creativity with functionality to design digital experiences that feel
        intuitive and unique. From personal projects to collaborative work, I am
        driven by curiosity, problem-solving, and the excitement of bringing
        ideas to life through clean design and thoughtful interaction. Whether
        it is building from scratch or revamping existing sites, I aim to make
        every project memorable and meaningful.
